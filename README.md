# Users-Backend-API
This project is a NodeJS with TypeScript API. It implements, with MongoDB, a CRUD system with a simple Login function. Feel free to contribute and follow me.

To run the project you will need to run the followed commands:
npm install
npm run start:dev

You will also need to configure the .env file with the MongoDB database credentials. 
The .env.example has example cretentials the might be the default for you.In this case I used a docker container with MongoDB to run in my local machine.
You can also configure with MongoDB Atlas credentials. This will allow you to run without having to use docker.

To test the REST API request, ou can use Postman.
